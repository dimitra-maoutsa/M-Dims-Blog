**This is a semi-organised collection of living texts on theoretical and computational neuroscience, nonlinear dynamics, probability theory, and machine learning theory, or whatever else manages to trigger my interest. **


Some early entries are adapted relics of my PhD thesis (including those bits that didn’t survive the final edits), while others are working notes that help me understand things better and might one day become something more formal. 


New posts will appear irregularly (when I feel like it). Old ones will get updated when I gain new insights, realise I was wrong, or I am bored and feel like procrastinating by refining them. 


Expect mostly math, neurons, and the occasional rabbit hole commentary.
