    "Back in **September 2023**, after the **Bernstein Conference**, I came back from **Alex Cayco-Gajic’s** workshop talk quite inspired. The **low tensor rank framework** she presented (work together with **Arthur Pellegrino** and **Angus Chadwick** @pellegrino2023low) had struck me as one of the more conceptually elegant approaches **to track how neural population dynamics change over learning**. I very enthusiastically shared my excitement in the internal post-Bernstein group meeting, as one does when ideas resonate[^1].\n",

    "It turned out that sharing my excitement about someone else’s work[^2] didn’t land equally well with everyone in the room, but that’s life. The dynamics that followed are perhaps best saved for a more informal conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few months later, in December 2023, I noticed the call for the ICLR 2024 blogpost track, and thought this would be a great opportunity to spotlight this work. I began drafting a piece, but for a mix of personal and political reasons (and admittedly, some competing deadlines), I set it aside[^3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I am still excited about this work, stay tuned here, I will soon revive this post.\n",

    "In the meantime, I recommend going straight to the source, **it’s a great read**.\n",
