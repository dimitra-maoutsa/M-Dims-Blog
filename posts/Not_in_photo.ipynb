    "Lately, I’ve come to realize that when certain things are left unsaid, well-meaning people will bend the story according to how it fits their narrative, regardless of what actually happened.\n",

    "Because of that, I’ve found myself in the uncomfortable position of having to share more personal details online than I normally would, just to preempt false narratives or quiet insinuations.\n",

    "One such case involves a recent group photo uploaded from a retreat organized in April 2024 by my previous research group. I am not pictured in that photo. **And given past patterns, I expect this absence will be used, subtly or not, to imply that I didn’t participate in the retreat at all.**\n",
    "\n",
    "So, here is what actually happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The retreat took place from **April 17–19, 2024**. I was actively involved: I prepared a flash talk on my own work, and co-prepared a joint talk with my colleagues Matt Getz and Pablo Crespo on our low-rank learning framework ([presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oDrFxc2aCzDteNMSVGniCC7XufMFvoZB/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=118137270217997530927&rtpof=true&sd=true)). First part was covered by matt, second by myself, and third by Pablo. Just five days later, on **April 24**, I was scheduled to give a talk at the Flatiron Institute in New York ([see here](https://indico.flatironinstitute.org/event/3961/)) on a completely different project, this one was a continuation of my PhD work, focused on inference of latent stochastic low-dimensional dynamics from spiking neural activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagine, time was tight. I would return on Friday 19th evening home, and I would depart on Monday 22 April for New York.\n",
    "On April 18th, the group went for a walk, after which the photo in question was taken. **I stayed back at the hotel to prepare for my upcoming talk.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a message I later found from my former colleague, Betsy Herbert, **calling me down to join the group photo**. I did see it at the time, my phone was on silent, as it almost always is.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Betsy asking me to come down to participate in the group photo](images/Betsy.jpg){width=400}\n",
    "\n",
    "So now, should someone choose to twist the narrative, here are the facts I have in my hands."
